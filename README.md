Do or do not!

Hard Thing About Hard Things:
"Here’s the thing about hard things, they’re hard. Seems redundant to say so and perhaps it is.  But the obviousness of that statement comes down to where you are in the process; contemplation or execution.  The contemplation stage has only a partial understand of what hard things require. Dangerously, the contemplation stage  can even include a romantic view of hard things based on focusing on some noble end result some distance down the road. The contemplation stage can easily see the spoils of the finish, but not the struggles of the process. It’s possible this is design. If everyone could fully understand what price some hard thing would exact, maybe very few would ever willingly venture into it. But for those who do, the transition from contemplation to execution represents the unmasking of pain. The unveiling of price.

So, the hard thing that seemed romanticly noble while basking in the glow of goals achieved, may feel different as the first inkling of real pain begins to set in."
